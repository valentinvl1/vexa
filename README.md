Vexa is an API for **real-time meeting transcription** using **meeting bots** and direct **streaming from web/mobile apps**. It extracts knowledge from various platforms including:

- **Google Meet**
- **Zoom** (coming soon)
- **Microsoft Teams** (coming soon)

It serves as an **privacy-first**, **open source** alternative to `recall.ai`.

It focuses on doing one job well: **clean, private, real-time transcription under your control so you can safely build on top**.




## Build on Top. In Hours, Not Months



**Build powerful meeting assistants (like Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Fathom) for your startup, internal use, or custom integrations.**

The Vexa API provides powerful abstractions and a clear separation of concerns, enabling you to build sophisticated applications on top with a safe and enjoyable coding experience. 

For instance, the **Vexa Example Client** (see [Projects Built with Vexa](BUILT-WITH-VEXA.md)) was built in just 3 hours of live coding with Cursor, showcasing the rapid development possible with Vexa.

Furthermore, with our **n8n integration** (see [Projects Built with Vexa](BUILT-WITH-VEXA.md) for examples), you can create incredibly complex workflows with no code, leveraging real-time transcription from Google Meet (with support for other platforms coming soon).
